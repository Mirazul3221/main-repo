                <p class="md:text-justify">
                    On Wednesday 30th of August, at the “Live with New Possibilities” seminar, Thailand Privilege officially revealed the new Thailand Elite Visa packages. These would come packed with new prices, benefits, requirements, and terms to abide by.
    
    The details of the Thai Elite Visa packages have been revealed by Thailand Privilege, but they will only be fully released on October 1, 2023. You can submit your application for the new package you want after that date. Before that, you can think about which options you’d like to consider based on the information given.
    
    However, if you want to apply for any of the current Thai Elite Visa packages, you have until September 15, 2023, at 4:30 PM to submit your application. To avoid delays and last minute complications, we highly recommend you submit it by September 14 at the latest.
